# A set of windows tools to help administer and manipulate the system

The purpose of this repo is to contain binary and ps options for various Windows utilities I build while learning more about different parts of the Windows OS and how to manipulate it.
The powershell script and binaries are designed to behave the same to prevent users from needing to know different arguments for each.
